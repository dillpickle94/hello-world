hello

 this is an edit
on a branch
 on a computer
   in the world of computers
    an internet
     has orizin
      arrived on the back of a fantastic crystal
     called sillicon
      now the valley had platued
       but it is risen again
        in toe of the motor carbon man
         who will reach the top
          well we already know\
          its we us humanity\
          but it wont seem like it at first
          not at all for a moment?
